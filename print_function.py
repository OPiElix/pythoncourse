#third python code as part of course (made on 25.08.2022)
#scope :  print() (or print in python)
#these are strings
print("Hello World")
#strings can be surrounded by both single (') and double (") quotes
print('Python 3 is cool')

#there are two types of numbers: integers (1, 3, 6, a.s.o.) and floating-point numbers (34.5, 5.0, -2.5, a.s.o.),
# short floats
#print() can be used with these too
print(5) #positive integer
print(3.5) #positive floating-point number (float)
print(-5) #negative integer
print(-3.5) #negative floating-point number (float)

#but if you put numbers in quotes, they are automatically strings
print('5') #no integer, but string
print('-4.9') #no float, but string
